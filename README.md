## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The `dev.sh` script manages everything:

Start by coming up with a basic outline of the plan with detailed summaries and psedo code or commands for things like generated the web client, researching the grpc website and available github repositories. Searching for up to date September 2025 information and reading over the appropriate documentation, etc.

Build out agents and if necessary a mmulti-level git working tree format to manage multiple projects.

Build out and plan a set of tasks to plan out a detailed plan and checklist and all related documentation and related notes from all the research you've done.

Use standards compliant approaches and setup the entire environment(s) required for the respective projects.
